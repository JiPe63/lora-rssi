# Experimental datasets of LoRa / LoRaWAN RSSI measurements

## LoRaWAN weather and signal strength dataset 

Dataset location: [/vineyard-2021_data](/vineyard-2021_data)

This is an experimental dataset of RSSI and SNR information, along with temperature, humidity and pressure data obtained from 8 LoRaWAN nodes and a reference weather station.

More details on the experimental setup and the tests carried out are under review. 

Please contact us if you plan to use this dataset.

## LoRa indoor and outdoor localization datataset 

This is an experimental dataset of LoRa RSSI measurements collected both indoor and in a real urban environment. 

Dataset location: [./localization-2018_data](./localization-2018_data)

Both the indoor and the outdoor coordinates are provided in meters (for the outdoor case, without decimal digits).
All exported maps and plans shows distances in meters but the indoor plan of the localisation tests (in this case, the scale shown on the bottom left corner is in centimeters and not meters).

More details on the experimental setup and the tests carried out have been published in our article entitled [Experimental data set analysis of RSSI-based indoor and outdoor localization in LoRa networks](https://doi.org/10.1002/itl2.75).
